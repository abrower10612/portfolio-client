    title: 'Platform Business Technology Director',

The growth I have seen in Andrew over 2 years of working with him is phenomenal, and he continues to have a hunger for improvement.

Andrew approaches his tasks with a positive attitude. He intuitively and appropriately balances tackling tough challenges on his own with bringing in teammates for collaborative discussion.
    
Throughout our professional relationship, Andrew has become a solid developer on both the back end and front end, and quite comfortable with transactional database concepts. It was a pleasure to watch him develop into taking on Senior-level responsibilities with confidence.
    
Andrew strives to understand the big picture, and has a talent for seeing potential gaps in specs or implementations. When Andrew began regularly proposing reusable and modular solutions to make the product and our process better, I knew he was truly thinking like a Senior.
    
Throughput and velocity from Andrew was always predictable and high. As much as he is a sponge for learning, he is also a champion for the product and advocate for his team members. Sone of Andrew's stand out traits are his humble graciousness and positive attitude.
    
Andrew is an all around model employee and I hope to find opportunities to work with him again in the future. The only reason we are parting ways is because the entire Technology Department was dissolved as the company put a pause on product development.`,

    name: 'Stephen Jones',
    title: 'Principal Front End Developer',
    body: `Andrew was one of the first additions to our development team as a full-stack developer. As the team was small when he joined he really had to live up to the moniker of his title and he did so with fantastic results. He switched with ease between front and back end development and had a very good understanding of the relationship between the two. Andrew grew immeasurably over the course of year and easily earned his change of role to that of a senior full-stack developer. He produced high quality code with equally high quality documentation. Andrew made significant contributions with the team’s ‘lunch and learn’ sessions and took over the role of leading our daily stand-ups. Andrew is an extremely affable person and I know that he will make a great addition to any future team. I will certainly miss working with him.`,
